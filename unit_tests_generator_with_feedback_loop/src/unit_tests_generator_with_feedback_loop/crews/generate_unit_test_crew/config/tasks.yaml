  description: >
    Generate comprehensive unit tests for the service class {service_class_name} in the {service_package_name} package using {coding_language} and {build_tool}.
    The project is located at: {clone_path}
    Use the directory list tool to explore the project structure at {clone_path} and the file read tool to read the service class file.

    If build feedback is provided, analyze the errors and generate improved tests that address the issues:
    Build Feedback: {build_feedback}
    Previous Generated Code: {generated_test_code}
  expected_output: >
    Complete, compilable unit test code for the service class {service_class_name} in the {service_package_name} package.
    The tests should use appropriate mocking frameworks and testing annotations for {coding_language}.

write_unit_test_task:
  description: >
    Write the generated unit test to the directory: {test_write_path}
    The test should be written for class: {service_class_name}
    Use the file writer tool to write the test code to the correct location with proper package declaration for {test_package_name}.
  expected_output: >
    The unit test file successfully created at {test_write_path} with complete test code and proper package declaration.
